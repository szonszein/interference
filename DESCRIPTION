Description: Design-based estimation of spillover effects in R. It estimates
    treatment effects and spillover effects under interference in the context of randomized
    experiments using the method of Aronow and Samii (2017, AOAS) for arbitrary but known
    interference networks, and the method of Hudgens and Halloran (2008, JASA) for the case
    where the interference network is unknown, but interference is limited to occurring within
    well-defined and non-overlapping groups.
